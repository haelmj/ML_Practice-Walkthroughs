# LinearRegression Walkthrough
Here we analyze student grade scores to predict the final grade

## DataFile
The current data file is `student-mat.csv`

### Setup
- Install the required modules from the `requirements.txt` in the main folder
- Run `test.py` either from the terminal or in an editor  
*Note*: A file named `studentmodel.pickle` will be created
- Open up `test.py` in an editor and comment out line 42
- Re-run `test.py`: It will then make predictions based off the model that was saved initially in the pickle file
